NAME
    Path::Executable - Find the locations in your PATH where commands appear

SYNOPSIS
      use Path::Executable;

      my @locations = path_exe( 'xml2-config' );

DESCRIPTION
    Path::Executable provides a convenient mechanism for determining if a
    command exists in multiple locations within $ENV{PATH}.

FUNCTIONS
    "path_exe"
        This function is exported by default, takes a single argument, the
        name of a command to look for in $ENV{PATH}. Returns an empty list
        if the command does not appear in the "PATH", otherwise it will
        return a list of the full command paths it has found.
